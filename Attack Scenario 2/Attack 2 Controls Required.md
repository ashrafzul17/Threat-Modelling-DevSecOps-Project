**Controls Required:**

- Regular API Security Assessments: Regularly test API endpoints for vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorized access to automated processes and sensitive data in the data lake.

- Automated Patch Management for APIs and Processes: Ensure that all API services and automated processes are updated to address any security vulnerabilities promptly.

- Segmentation of Automated Processes: Restrict automated processes and data lake access based on least privilege to prevent exploitation of process vulnerabilities.

- Data Encryption and Access Controls: Encrypt sensitive data within the data lake and enforce access controls, limiting access to authorized users only.

- Enhanced Logging and Monitoring: Implement logging and continuous monitoring on API and data lake activities to detect and respond to suspicious behavior.

- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for API Access: Require MFA for users and services accessing critical APIs and automated processes to improve authentication security.

- Rate Limiting on APIs: Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse of API calls and deter attackers from easily conducting large-scale attacks on the data lake.
