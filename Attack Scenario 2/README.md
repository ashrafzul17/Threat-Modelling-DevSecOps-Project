# Attack 2 Summary: Attack against Machine Processes and the Data Lake

## Stages of the Attack

### Origins
The attacker targets the data lake and automated processes within the Solaris Health 360 application, aiming to exploit weak points in machine processes to gain access to sensitive aggregated data.

### Reconnaissance
Detailed research is conducted on the data lake architecture, machine learning workflows, and APIs. The attacker identifies potential process automation weaknesses.

### Weaponization
The attacker crafts specialized scripts to disrupt the machine processes and access data in the data lake, including data extraction payloads or algorithms designed to alter machine process behaviors.

### Delivery
Attackers deploy the payload through insecure API endpoints or by injecting scripts into automated data processes.

#### Exploitation
Vulnerabilities in machine learning models or API workflows are exploited, enabling unauthorized access to data stored in the data lake.

### Installation
Once inside, attackers embed additional scripts or malware to ensure ongoing access and manipulate data processes, potentially leading to altered health insights or unauthorized data aggregation.

### Actions on Objectives
The attacker exfiltrates sensitive data, potentially altering patient records or compromising data used in health analytics.
