**Controls Required:**

- Third-Party Vendor Risk Assessments: Regular assessments of third-party vendorsâ€™ security practices to ensure alignment with organization standards.

- Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Regular scanning of third-party software for known vulnerabilities and potential malicious code.

- Digital Signatures and Integrity Checks: Require digital signatures on all software updates and conduct integrity checks to detect unauthorized changes.

- Network Segmentation: Isolate third-party systems from sensitive internal networks to limit attacker movement if compromised.

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA on systems accessing third-party software to reduce the impact of unauthorized access.

- Backdoor and Malware Detection: Implement continuous monitoring for known backdoors, malware signatures, and abnormal patterns within third-party integrations.

- Incident Response Plan for Supply Chain Attacks: Develop a rapid incident response plan specifically for supply chain attacks to reduce response time and potential damage.

- Audit Logs and Monitoring: Track and monitor third-party interactions with sensitive systems to quickly identify any unauthorized activity.
