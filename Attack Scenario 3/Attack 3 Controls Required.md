**Controls Required:**

- Input Validation: Implement input validation to sanitize all data entered by users, ensuring no SQL commands can be processed.

- Parameterized Queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user inputs.

- Database Security: Restrict database user permissions so that only essential data can be accessed by the application and minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

- Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts before they reach the application.

- Monitoring and Logging: Enable real-time monitoring and logging to detect unusual database activities, such as suspicious queries, for early detection of SQL injection attempts.

- Regular Security Testing: Conduct regular security testing, such as penetration tests and vulnerability scans, to identify and address SQL injection vulnerabilities proactively.

- Error Handling: Ensure the application handles errors securely without exposing database structure or information that could aid attackers.
