**Controls Required:**

- Access Control Reviews: Regularly review and limit access rights to sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to critical resources like quant algorithms.

- Enhanced Logging and Monitoring: Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect unusual access patterns, including file access frequency and external transfers.

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Use DLP solutions to monitor, detect, and block unauthorized data transfers, especially to external or removable media.

- User Behavior Analytics (UBA): Deploy UBA to identify anomalies in insider activities, such as attempts to access restricted areas or modify logs.

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Require MFA for accessing sensitive databases and storage systems to reduce unauthorized access risks.

- Periodic Insider Threat Training: Conduct regular training for all staff on identifying insider threats, with emphasis on reporting suspicious behavior and activity.

- Privileged Access Management (PAM): Enforce PAM for privileged users, ensuring access is granted only when needed and is closely monitored.

- Automated Alerting Systems: Establish automated alerts for sensitive data access and modification, notifying the security team of potential insider activities.
